## Python
Python was chosen in mind to help create an overall CLI tool that would allw people to pull out information regarding their Salesforce interactions. The main modules used are listed below:

- **[Simple-Salesforce](https://pypi.org/project/simple-salesforce/)**
- **[Salesforce-Reporting](https://pypi.org/project/salesforce-reporting/)**

The main reason as to why these two modules were chosen is because Salesforce stores things in terms of Objects. Furthermore, they the output returned is in JSON Format from a SQL Query. SalesForce calls this Salesforce Object Query Language, however the structure is very similar to SQL Statements similar to a SELECT FROM statement. 

**SOQL Samples:**
```
"SELECT Id, Email FROM Contact WHERE LastName = 'Jones'"
```
